          As well as actively pursuing a bachelor of software engineering at the University of Victoria, I am currently a varsity coxswain with the University of Victoria's vikes! Being a coxswain gives plenty of time to work on my interpersonal skills. practicing 2-4 hours a day over the past 3 years has given me thousands of hours to fine-tune my ability to: work as a team member, listen to and understand both verbal and non-verbal messages, and finally but most importantly understand and manage my emotions and my actions. as memtioned eariler 2-4 hours of practice a day mixed with a full engineering course load doesn't leave much time to waste! given this situation i have had to calibrate my time-management skills. improvements to my productivity and work ethic are very important to me and allow me to be successful in both my rowing and engineering careers.
